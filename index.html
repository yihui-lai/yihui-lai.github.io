<br>I am a Ph.D. student in the CMS group at <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu/research/research-areas/high-energy-physics.html">University of Maryland</a>. 
My research interests lie in the elementary particle physics.<br>

<!--  Previously, I was a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, working in the <a
	href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/">Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)</a>, advised by <a
	href="https://clsp.wse.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/sanjeev/">Sanjeev Khudanpur</a> and <a
	href="http://www.danielpovey.com/">Dan Povey</a>. I was a JHU-Amazon AI2AI fellow, a Fred Jelinek fellow, and
an IEEE Rising Star in Signal Processing.<br><br>

<!-- I have interned in the speech groups at Microsoft (in 2021) and Meta (in 2022). <br><br> -->

<!--  My bachelor thesis was on deep learning methods
for relation extraction in clinical text, supervised by <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/anand.ashish/index.html">Ashish
	Anand</a>.<br><br> -->

<br> When Iâ€™m not doing research, I like outdoor activities like hiking, skiing, and traveling!<br>
